In 2018 I [gave a talk about the browser event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0). Folks said I should put the animations online. Five years later, I found the time. This is that.

# Worrying about code

Before I understood the event loop, I'd worry about seemingly simple code like this. It's adding an element to the page, then hiding it.

Was this causing the browser to lay the document out with the new element, only to throw away all that work by hiding the element?

Might the user see a flash of the element, if the code ran slowly for some reason?

I didn't know the answer, so, for safety, I'd swap those lines around.

Disaster averted.

```js
document.body.append(el);
el.style.display = 'none';
```

But, now I understand the event loop, I know that the order of those lines doesn't matter, and the user will never see a flash of content between the two. Hopefully by the end of this animated book-type-thing, hopefully you'll understand the event loop too.
